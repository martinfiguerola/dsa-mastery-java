# 🚀 Java Logic & LeetCode Preparation

Welcome to my journey of mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using Java. My goal is to build a solid foundation in programming logic to ace technical interviews and solve complex problems on LeetCode.

## 📌 Road Map
- [ ] **Phase 1: fundamentals & Control Flow** (In Progress 🛠️)
- [ ] **Phase 2: Linear Data Structures** (Arrays, Lists, Strings, Big O Notation)
- [ ] **Phase 3: Advanced Structures** (HashMaps, Stacks, Queues, and Recursion)
- [ ] **Phase 4: Algorithms & Patterns** (Binary Search, Sorting, Two Pointers, Sliding Window)
- [ ] **Phase 5: Interview Prep** (Mock interviews, technical communication)


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java ☕
* **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA
* **Platform:** LeetCode / HackerRank
